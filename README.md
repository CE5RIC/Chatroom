CHATROOM EXERCISE

a becode project

Ok! This exercise actually got me really excited!
As a high school kid in the early 2000's I remember the days of MSN Messenger very well.
I can still hear them sounds and literally everyone was on it.
So when we got this exercise as part of our Becode training I think it's very cool to build something we used so much back in the day. Who would've thought I would be able to do build something by myself all these year later. Well hold your horses, not quite there yet.

So what are the learning goals here?

[x]Set up a node environment
[x]Make a connection between different clients and the servers
[x]Work with sockets
[x]Configure express and socket.io for node
[x]Make a basic chatroom

Some must-have features?

[x]Make a UI that makes it easy for people to send messages in this chatroom.
[x]It must be possible to send a message to everyone or to yourself
[]Make sure we can identify who sent the message through a username.
[]We could make a local variable and prompt the user to choose a username
[]We can then emit this username along with the sent message to keep track of who sent what.
[]Make a list to show everyone who is connected to the chatroom
[]Implement something funny! The sky is the limit! (it can be very simple if you want)
For example, you could make a functionality to make someone else's font size obscurely small!
You could implement a feature where you can speak with someone else's username
AND SO MUCH MORE -> BE CREATIVE

If I finish all these must haves I will try to make it as close as possible to the original MSN from back in the day! That is my goal for this assignment.
